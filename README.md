# Project Description
Background:
Website XYZ, a music-listening social networking website, follows
the “freemium” business model. The website offers basic services for free, and provides a
number of additional premium capabilities for a monthly subscription fee.

Question:
We are interested in **predicting which people would be likely to convert from free users to premium subscribers
in the next 6 month period**, if they are targeted by our promotional campaign. 

Resrources:
Dataset contains 41,540 records (1540 adopters and 40,000 non-adopters), each record representing
a different user of the XYZ website who was targeted in the previous marketing campaign.
Each record is described with 25 attributes.
